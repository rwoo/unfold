This module contains the code that is not domain-specific.

This module focuses on UI.

The Vision
==========

The UI focuses on documents that are results of intellectual work and any kind of craftsmanship. These documents
have have to get more emphasis than the documents that have merely contributed to its evolution.
We value them and the UI shall express this appreciation.

All other documents that contributed to the final document are set in context to the final document and its
role in its evolution.

If a new document comes into the center of the view, the summaries of related documents open up
as a hand held fan does.

The related documents are positioned around the pivotal document and they spread on circular pathways.

When the user decides to move another document to the center of the view, then the summary of the 
chosen document *unfolds* and moves to the center of the view. For that movement a summary is considered 
a flat bunch of typographic elements that overlay each other. When the summary moves to centre the 
single pieces drift apart on spiral pathways to their final positions on the unfold representation. 
The older documents fades out. The documents related to the new pivotal document replace the old 
documents by pushing them away, again on circular pathways.

When a user positions her mouse over a summary or document, then the related documents are emphasied 
depending on the strength of the relationship.

It is possible to browse through the documents of the folder the pivotal document belongs to. When the
user decides to do this, the summaries that belong that documents disappear behind the pivotal document.
Browsing resembles the conventional browsing in a book apart from that the documents are considered 
transparent or almost transparent as soon as the user starts to turn the page. This way it looks as 
only the typeset is moved.


Technical details
=================

Summaries are different representations of documents. For a specific summary it is always defined which
documents have contributed to its content. A document can be numerous summaries, each for a different
purpose.

We call the document and the summaries around the default dashboard.
The user can define other dashboards. The elements of the dashboards shall be flat and shall not contain
expandable or nested content.

We provide another dashboard to positions two documents side on side, which makes comparison easy.

To resize a summary it will be moved to the center of the view and then resized.
